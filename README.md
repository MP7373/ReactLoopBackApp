# React LoopBack App

Just practicing by building some example projects.
I really like how easy it is to set up an API with LoopBack
compared to how long it takes to write manually with express.

If you are interested this project follows this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx-cywTNy8s&list=PLillGF-RfqbZjJBAu0sx_0SCuFdzdx4iY) and you can follow along and build it yourself.
